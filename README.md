## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores **causality inference** through **Granger Causality (GC) simulations** to assess the sensitivity and robustness of inference methods. The simulations help evaluate how different noise levels, data distributions, and model assumptions impact causality detection in time-series data.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Granger Causality (GC) Simulations** – Evaluating causality in synthetic time-series data  
✅ **Inference Sensitivity Analysis** – Testing model robustness under varying conditions  
✅ **Graph-based Causal Structures** – Representing causal relationships using **NetworkX**  
✅ **Statistical Testing & Validation** – Using **statsmodels** for hypothesis testing  
✅ **Visualization of Results** – Plotting inference performance with **Matplotlib**  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data handling & preprocessing  
- **Statsmodels** – Granger causality tests & regression models  
- **NetworkX** – Graph-based causal structure visualization  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
 

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- Simulated **time-series data** to evaluate Granger causality under various conditions.  
- Sensitivity analysis showed that **causal inference accuracy** depends on **noise levels, lag selection, and sample size**.  
- Graph-based visualizations help interpret **causal relationships** effectively.

## Granger causality Inference

Thinking about a alrge set of functions which influence each other in various sizes and relationships the Granger causality test can help to detect these. This work examines different approaches implemented in different libraries, in Python and R, to measure different kind of relationships
and interactions linear and nonlinear and the sensitivities regarding e. g. the error term, approached significance levels or sample size. In order to gain full control about the relationship the data is simulated manually over a variation of different settings.
